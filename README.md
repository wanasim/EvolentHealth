To run the app, **follow these steps**:

* `npm install`
* `npm start` is the JavaScript entry point.

This app is a React-Redux application that utilizes the React-Redux package. Although "vanilla" Redux could be used, React-Redux allows for more abstraction (e.g. do not have to pass store down components). Please note nothing is persisted so refreshing the page will default to the initial state.

A single actions file (`index.js`) contains several actions to add/create/delete contacts while a single reducer file (`index.js`) listens for any actions and updates the store accordingly. The reducer file also initializes the store with a contact.

The root file (`App.js`) leverages React-Redux's connect method to access the store and passes down state (all contacts) and action creators (such as add and delete) to child components.

**Routes**:
* `/`: list all contacts
* `/create`: create contact
* `/edit/:id`: edits a specific contact
